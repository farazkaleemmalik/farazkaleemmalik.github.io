The original repo is part of the courses Github org, so not under my personal account.

### Some of the features I worked on

- Registration process, which includes emailing a code to verify ownership of email address
- Email announcement opt-in settings, and also email announcement handlers
- Announcements drawer in navbar
- Dynamic apply button component
- All of the above include both the UI and endpoints (with database querying)
