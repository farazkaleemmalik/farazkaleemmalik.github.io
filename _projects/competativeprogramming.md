description: A summary of my competitive programming history
---

I started competitive programming in 2018. For training, I've mostly stuck with the [DM::OJ](https://dmoj.ca) competitive judge as they are based in Canada, and hosted many CCCesque contests. They also uploaded all past CCC problems with good test cases.
