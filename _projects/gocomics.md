An open source npm package which scrapes gocomics.com for specific comic image links. Since being published in 2018, has gained 6 stars on Github, ~1000 downloads on npm, and successful forks and pull requests.

I honestly didn't really have too many expectations for people to use my open source code, so it was a nice surprise to see issues, and even pull request on my repository.
