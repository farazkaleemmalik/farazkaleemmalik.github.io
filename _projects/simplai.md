Since most of the cool stuff is in their respective links, I'll just link them here.

## Links
- [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/simpl-ai) - We got second place in HTV7!
- [Github](https://github.com/UnderTheTableHTV7/HTV7)
- [Demo](http://simplai.bobloblaw.tech/) - The backend API is no longer up but we can keep the frontend since it uses github pages. At least until the domain.com registration expires :(
