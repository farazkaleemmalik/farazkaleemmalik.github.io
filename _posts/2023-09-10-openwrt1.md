title: Installing OpenWRT onto Linksys E5400
---

I installed OpenWRT on a router using the TFTP method, using a Linux system as the host.

## Overview

A lot of these instructions can be derived from the [official OpenWRT page](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e5400) for the E5400 but the details were a bit sparse, so I needed to do lots of Googling on my own. This post is a compilation of information needed to complete the installation and setup. Unlike the wiki, these instructions are comprehensive and detailed on where I managed to stumble.

### Step 1: Opening the router
We need a way to interact with the bootloader. We do this by opening a serial console via UART.

We first need to open the router, by tearing through the sticker and unscrewing at the locations below.

Then, run a shim across the top lid, and attempt to slide off the cover towards the front of the router. This part was surprisingly difficult for me; I broke a few plastic bits before finally getting it off. The router should now look as below.

Carefully remove the antenna connectors at the bottom center-left, the slide the pcb out of the case.

### Step 2: Soldering pin headers
The pcb should needs to be soldered with a 5-pin breakaway header where shown. Remember to have the long parts pointing up, and the plastic bit above the pcb.

This is great practice for someone learning to solder, so don't let this daunt you! Now you can place the board into its case, and reattach antennae.

### Step 3: Creating a serial console
We now need to talk to the router. To do this you will need a UART to USB adapter. While this can be bought individually, many microcontroller boards have one built in that we can abuse. Here I use an Arduino Uno, and connect the RESET pin to GND for the desired effect.

The Uno is connected to the host system through USB. The female-to-male jumper wires are connected as shown:
