title: Installing OpenWRT onto Linksys E5400
---

I installed OpenWRT on a $15 router using the TFTP method, enabling WIPS and the OpenVPN extension.

### Overview

Alot of these instructions can be derived from the [official OpenWRT page](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e5400) for the E5400 but the details were a bit sparse, so I needed to do lots of Googling on my own. This post is meant to be a compilation of information I needed to complete the installation and setup.

#### Step 1: Getting a Serial Connection

Firstly we need a way to interact with the bootloader. The only way to do this seems to be through the serial console through the UART pins. We first need to open the router, by tearing through the sticker and unscrewing at the locations below.
