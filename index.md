Hello! I'm Faraz Malik, a Computer Science student at UofT Scarbrough currently on my second year. I am passionate about a wide variety of areas in software and hardware, including microcontrollers, SBC and SoC programming, web development, IoT, and cybersecurity.

On this personal website you will find my portfolio of projects I have managed to document properly, my resume, my blog (mainly for CTF writeups), and some social links in the footer.

### Below are some of my best [projects](/projects):

**[UTSC Clubhouse](/projects/clubhouse)**: A MERN webapp for managing student organizations. Features include viewing clubs, applying to clubs, viewing club events, and opt in email notifications. The app was written over a 4 month term by a team of 7 using Agile and Scrum methodology.

**[Simpl.ai](/projects/simplai)**: A React webapp that uses NLP to recognize difficult text and rephrase it to easy-to-understand language. This app was written over a weekend for Hack the Valley 7 @ UTSC, winning my team 2nd place overall out of ~100 submissions.

**[gocomics-api](/projects/gocomics)**: An open source npm package which scrapes gocomics.com for specific comic image links. Since being published in 2018, has gained 6 stars on Github, ~1000 downloads on npm, and successful forks and pull requests.
